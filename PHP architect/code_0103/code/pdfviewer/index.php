<h1>Inicode PDF Viewer Demo</h1>
This demo will let you upload and view online a PDF file of up to six pages or two hundred kilobytes. Please contact info@inicode.com if you require assistance or if you would like to inquire about this Inicode product.
<p>
Please select a file to upload:
<br>
<FORM ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data" ACTION="upload.php" METHOD=POST> 
<INPUT TYPE="hidden" name="200000" value="1000"> 
Send this file: <INPUT NAME="userfile" TYPE="file"> 
<INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Send File"> 
</FORM>
<p>
<b>Please Note:</b> Please be patient while uploading your file, as this is only a test machine and disposes of very limited processing power. Please keep in mind that, in a real-world environment, each PDF file would have to be uploaded only once and that access to it would be absolutely immediate after it has been uploaded.
<br>
The apparent slowness of this system is caused by the fact that its simple interface lacks the ability to store and retrieve each PDF for later viewing; therefore, each PDF uploaded--even if it has been uploaded before--will have to be reprocessed in its entirety <i>every time</i>.

{"talks":[{"talk_title":"Designing Beautiful Software","talk_description":"Software is a craft. Like any craft, the software we build can be either hastily put together with little love, or well crafted for longevity. Typically in software, we look at how extensible and maintainable a system may be in order to judge its quality.\n\nIn this session, we\u2019ll take a practical example, and develop it from a quick one-liner into a re-usable component. Along the way, we\u2019ll discuss the choices we make as developers, and how they affect both how we develop and the results we produce. The goal of the session is to inspire developers to create beautiful software.","start_date":"2012-12-21T14:50:00-06:00","average_rating":5,"comments_enabled":1,"comment_count":14,"speakers":[{"speaker_name":"Matthew Weier O'Phinney","speaker_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/users\/17"}],"tracks":[],"uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/talks\/7938","verbose_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/talks\/7938?verbose=yes","website_uri":"http:\/\/joind.in\/talk\/view\/7938","comments_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/talks\/7938\/comments","verbose_comments_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/talks\/7938\/comments?verbose=yes","event_uri":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/1175"}],"meta":{"count":1,"this_page":"http:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/talks\/7938?start=0&resultsperpage=20"}}

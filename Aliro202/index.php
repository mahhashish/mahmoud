 * parts of Mambo 4.6.
 *
 * Tribute should be paid to all the developers who took Mambo to the stage
 * it had reached at the time Aliro was created.  It is a feature rich system
 * that contains a good deal of innovation.
 *
 * Your attention is also drawn to the fact that Aliro relies on other items of
 * open source software, which is very much in the spirit of open source.  Aliro
 * wishes to give credit to those items of code.  Please refer to

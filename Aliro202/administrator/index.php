 *
 * The author freely draws attention to the fact that Aliro derives from Mambo,
 * software that is controlled by the Mambo Foundation.  However, this section
 * of code is totally new.  If it should contain any fragments that are similar
 * to Mambo, please bear in mind (1) there are only so many ways to do things
 * and (2) the author of Aliro is also the author and copyright owner for large
 * parts of Mambo 4.6.
 *
 * Tribute should be paid to all the developers who took Mambo to the stage
 * it had reached at the time Aliro was created.  It is a feature rich system
 * that contains a good deal of innovation.
 *
 * Your attention is also drawn to the fact that Aliro relies on other items of
 * open source software, which is very much in the spirit of open source.  Aliro
 * wishes to give credit to those items of code.  Please refer to
 * http://aliro.org/credits for details.  The credits are not included within
 * the Aliro package simply to avoid providing a marker that allows hackers to
 * identify the system.

 * This is the starting point for all admin interactions with Aliro, the index.php
 * file for the admin side.  It contains a minimum of code.  It is designed so that
 * it should be possible to vary the name of the administrator directory, although
 * this name is so entrenched in add-on software that it is likely to be hard to
 * achieve.

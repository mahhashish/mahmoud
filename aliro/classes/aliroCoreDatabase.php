 * The author freely draws attention to the fact that Aliro derives from Mambo,
 * software that is controlled by the Mambo Foundation.  However, this section
 * of code is totally new.  If it should contain any fragments that are similar
 * to Mambo, please bear in mind (1) there are only so many ways to do things
 * and (2) the author of Aliro is also the author and copyright owner for large
 * parts of Mambo 4.6.
 *
 * Tribute should be paid to all the developers who took Mambo to the stage
 * it had reached at the time Aliro was created.  It is a feature rich system
 * that contains a good deal of innovation.
 *
 * Your attention is also drawn to the fact that Aliro relies on other items of
 * open source software, which is very much in the spirit of open source.  Aliro
 * wishes to give credit to those items of code.  Please refer to
 * http://aliro.org/credits for details.  The credits are not included within

 *
 * aliroCoreDatabase is a singleton extension of the abstract database class.
 * It is the optionally separate database holding critical tables relating only to
 * the core of Aliro, such as information about menus, components, etc.  It is also
 * the only place where user passwords are stored, thus reducing the impact of
 * SQL injection attacks that penetrate only the general database.  If it is not
 * possible to have two databases, Aliro will run with both being the same.
 *
 * Other names are purely for compatibility and are deprecated.

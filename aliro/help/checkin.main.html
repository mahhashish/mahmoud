          <td width="84%" valign="top" class="data">When a User edits a file,
               Mambo changes its status to, &quot;Checked Out&quot;. In effect,
               the file is locked and only the User who has &quot;checked it
               out&quot; has permission to work with it. This is a security feature
               that prevents two Users from editing a document at the same time,
               thus preventing loss of data upon saving.A Content Item remains &#39;Checked
               Out&#39; until the User clicks &#39;Save&#39; or &#39;Cancel&#39; while
               editing the Content Item, at which time the Content Item is &quot;Checked
               In&quot;. However, if there&#39;s a connection error, the user
               presses the &#39;Back&#39; icon in his/her browser, or the User
               chooses another Menu Item without saving or canceling the work
               in progress, the Content Item remains &#39;Checked Out&#39;. This
               means no one can edit it. This is usually reported or experienced
               as Users being unable to edit or access items, and can be verified
               by looking&nbsp;at the column labeled &quot;Checked Out&quot; in
               the Section, Category, or Item file list .Mambo has a protocol,
               called &quot;Global Checkin&quot; that allows an administrator
               to unlock all Content Items that are currently &quot;Checked Out&quot;.To
               perform the &quot;Global Check In&quot;, select System &gt; Global
               Check In from the Administrator Menubar.&nbsp; After performing
               the &quot;Global Check In&quot;, Mambo returns a list showing
               how many items, and from which tables, were Checked back in.<strong><font color="#CC0000">WARNING:</font></strong><font color="#CC0000"> Be
               very careful in doing this as anyone who is editing a document
          at that very moment can have his or her work lost.</font></td>

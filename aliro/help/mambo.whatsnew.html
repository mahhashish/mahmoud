<h1>What's New in Version 4.6</h1>
Version 4.6 represents another milestone for the Mambo open source CMS project.  In 4.6 much of the underlying code has been rewritten and optimized.  Mambo now uses significantly fewer database calls during its normal operation.  A large number of bugs have been corrected.  A new feature rich default editor and user friendly database backup utility have been added.  Plus more...

<h1>Templates</h1>
New templates have been added to this release.  Special thanks to Water & Stone for donating these!  The new templates really show off what's possible with Mambo's flexible templating system.

<h1>Help System Changes</h1>
New help screens have been added and the help system has been expanded to help decrease inaccuracies in the delivery of help content.  New and updated screenshots have been added.  A lot work has gone into the contextual help screens as well. 

<h1>Components</h1>
<h2>MOStlyCE</h2>
MOStlyCE is the new default editor for Mambo.  MOStlyCE is based on the latest version of TinyMCE and the old mosCE project.  MOStlyCE offers some great new enhancements like editor compression for faster load times and reduced traffic, a customizable interface, and ability to enable / disable plugins as needed.  There are also a number of great new plugins like a spellchecker, layer support, etc.  Enjoy!

<h2>MOStlyDBAdmin</h2>
MOStlyDBAdmin is a new component based on the old dbadmin component.  Some minor tweaks and security fixes have been applied.  This component offers users an easy way to backup and restore Mambo's database.

<h2>Comments</h2>
v4.6 offers a new built-in comments component for handling end user comments.  

<h1>Installers</h1>
<h2>Universal Installer</h2>
The individual installers for templates, mambots, components, etc have been removed.  Version 4.6 brings a new Universal Installer capable of installing any type of Mambo package (i.e.) Component, Module, Mambot, and/or Template.

<h2>Add-On Installer</h2>
Another new installation method is the Add-On Installer.  It requires PHP5 and will be displayed under the Installers menu if the system has the required PHP5 version.  The Add-On installer displays a list of official Mambo add-on packages that can be installed with the click of a button.  Any number and/or type of packages can be installed with 1 simple click.  You'll recognize many of these as formerly built in Mambo core items.  With Mambo Raw we have started to slim down the core and thus are offering pulled packages as fully installable add-ons.  We like to call it Mambo Your Way.

This is also the spot to find Peer Reviewed / Certified 3rd Party Add-Ons.  Note though the process for certifying add-ons is still in the works so when 4.6 is released this list will be empty until we have had time to get this effort officially underway.

<h1>Other New Features</h1>
<h2>Check For Updates</h2>
The Check For Updates feature requires PHP5 and will be displayed under the System menu if the system has the required PHP5 version.  This new feature checks the Mambo Foundation server to see if you are running the latest version and/or patch of Mambo and will offer suggestions if not.  It can also be used to display messages to Mambo admins and may come in handy as a tool to communicate things like security warnings.  The functionality is not automatic at this time.  It will not update Mambo automatically, this is still a manual process.   It also does not check for updates without the user requesting it do so.

<h2>Enhanced Language Manager</h2>
Version 4.6 brings an enhanced language manager that allows for simple translation of the Mambo core.

<h2>Spam Protection</h2>
Optional CAPTCHA authentication has been added to the core. By requiring the user 
pass a CAPTCHA test before submitting contact or comment contents automated spam 
entries by bots should be elimitated.

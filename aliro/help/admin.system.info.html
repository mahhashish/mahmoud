     <tr>
          <td width="16%" align="right" valign="top" bgcolor="#EFEFEF" class="datalabel">Purpose:</td>
          <td width="84%" valign="top" class="data"><p>The information
                    is displayed in a tabbed format with three main sections
                    of content.</p>
               <ul>
                    <li><strong>System Info Tab</strong>: This a
                         broad snapshot of the server and versions of the current
                         installation components of your Mambo site. Here you
                         will find your PHP build and version, your MySQL database
                         version along with the Mambo version and relevant settings
                         that your server has set that might interfere with your
                         current site installation. Here, you will also find
                         the contents of your Mambo Configuration file. This
                         file is produced when you perform the installation of
                         Mambo on your server, and is changed when you make changes
                              to in the global configuration section of the Administration
                              of Mambo. This file defines many of the global
                         variables that Mambo uses to execute. You can not edit
                         the file from here, but it does allow you to look at
                         your current settings to find problems or to copy the
                         information.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>PHP
                         Info Tab</strong>: PHP is the server side scripting
                         language that Mambo runs on. This language is installed
                         and executes on the server, and therefore all the settings
                         are made on that server. Everything you ever wanted
                         to know about the PHP installation on your Mambo server
                         is listed here. How much control you have over changing
                         this information depends on whether you own the server
                         or if your server host is willing to work with you on
                         needed changes. The PHP tab will allow you to look at
                         all the settings and variables that define your PHP
                         installation. It is a good practice to insure that you
                         know what requirements are needed for any &#39;Third
                         Party&#39; Components that you plan to use with Mambo. You
                    can then check for those requirements here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>Permissions
                         Tab</strong>:&nbsp;Displays a list of all critical Mambo
                         directories that should be writable in order for Mambo to
                         function correctly.&nbsp;If you find a directory that is
                         not writable, you should change it to writable. You cannot
                         do it from here. You have to do it using your FTP&nbsp;client,
               or asking your hoster to do it for you.</li>

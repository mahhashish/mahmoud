                    Manager allows you to control a number of variables that
                    affect your site as a whole. Changes made on this screen
                    will update the configuration.php file; accordingly, this
                    file must be writable. When your site is configured,
                    it is a good idea to make configuration.php unwritable for
                    security reasons. </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Site Offline</strong> - Takes the front end of your website 
          on or offline. Use this option if you are updating the site and do not 
          wish to have your visitors view the site until you are finished.</li>
        <li><strong>Offline Message</strong> - When the Site Offline switch is 
          in the Yes position, this field sets the default message that displays 
          for your site visitors.</li>
        <li><strong>System Error Message</strong> - This message will display 
          if the initial database connection fails.&nbsp; You can type anything 
          you like in this box.</li>
        <li><strong>Site Name</strong> - Sets the name of the site. This will 
          display in the Title Bar of the visitors' browsers and will also show 
          in system-generated emails. </li>
        <li><strong>ShowUnauthorised Links</strong> -&nbsp;With this option turned 
          on, visitors&nbsp;will see all links, including those to Content Items 
          to which the visitor may not have access, (that is, content given an 
          Access Level of &#39;Registered&#39; or &#39;Special&#39;). With this 
          option off, they will only see links to content with an Access Level 
          of &#39;Public&#39;.</li>
        <li><strong>Allow User Registration</strong> - This option allows you 
          to set whether visitors can register for a user account. If the &quot;Yes&quot; 
          radio button is chosen, the Login Form will include the prompt &ldquo;No 
          account yet? Create one&quot;. If the &quot;No&quot; radio button is 
          chosen, they will not be presented with an option to register.</li>
        <li><strong>Use New Account Activation</strong> - If the &quot;Yes&quot; 
          radio button is chosen, an activation link will be sent to user&#39;s 
          e-mail address. A new user can not login until he has clicked on the 
          activation link.&nbsp; If the &quot;No&quot; radio button is chosen, 
          Users will be able to login right away without activation.</li>
        <li><strong>Email New User Password</strong> - With this option set to 
          &#39;Yes&#39;, the new user will receive an email with a password generated 
          by Mambo. If it is set to &#39;No&#39;, new Users will select their 
          own password.</li>
        <li><strong>Require Unique Email</strong> - Select whether you want to 
          prevent registration with duplicate e-mail addresses. In combination 
          with user activation this option prevents users from signing up more 
          than once using the same e-mail address.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Captcha Authentication</strong> - Select whether users 
          are required to enter verification details from a security image before 
          submitting forms. This stops automatic form submissions such as spam.</li>
        <li><strong>Debug Site</strong> - This option allows you to view the error 
          messages that are created by your site&#39;s php installation. It can 
          be a handy tool for debugging if you are having problems and for reporting 
          errors to your System Administrator or Web host.</li>
        <li><strong>WYSIWYG Editor</strong> - Choose which of the installed Text 
          Editors you want to use to edit Content Items.</li>
        <li><strong>List Length</strong> - Choose a default length for lists in 
          the Admin system.</li>
        <li><strong>Favourites Site Icon</strong> - This sets the icon that appears 
          in some browsers next to the name and/or address of your site.&nbsp; 
          By default this is the Mambo flower.&nbsp; If you want another icon 
          to show up, you must upload another icon to replace the Mambo flower.&nbsp;</li>

                         a language other than that deployed with the system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time
                         Offset</strong>: This option sets the time offset in

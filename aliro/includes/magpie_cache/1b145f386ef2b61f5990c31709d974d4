He begins playing a song to the buttoned down and sitting down Web 2.0 crowd. Meanwhile there&#8217;s an audible drone of people talking in the back of the large room.

<P>Between songs Lou looks pissed, but I think that&#8217;s normal. He tells the crowd, &#8220;You can keep on talking, I&#8217;ve only got 20 minutes. Or I can turn up the music. I can turn it up so loud it will hurt. Do you want me to turn it up? Do you want me to make it hurt?&#8221; (rough paraphrase). <em>How awkward.</em>

<P>He&#8217;s met with some faint cheering/clapping to turn it up, so over the mike to his sound guy, he growls, &#8220;Frank turn it up!&#8221; Frank probably thought he was joking. Lou repeats himself once or twice: &#8220;Frank, turn it up, Frank turn up the sound!&#8221;<br clear="all"></blockquote>  <a href="http://justinsomnia.org/2006/11/lou-reed-20/">Link</a>

From Air & Space magazine:
<blockquote>More than 1,000 Earth pictures were returned from V-2s between 1946 and 1950, from altitudes as high as 100 miles. The photos, showing huge expanses of the American southwest, appeared in newspapers and were scrutinized by scientists from the U.S. Weather Bureau. In his (1950) National Geographic article, (Clyde) Holliday, (who developed the camera that captured the images), offered a few predictions as to where it all might lead: "Results of these tests now are pointing to a time when cameras may be mounted on guided missiles for scouting enemy territory in war, mapping inaccessible regions of the earth in peacetime, and even photographing cloud formations, storm fronts, and overcast areas over an entire continent in a few hours." Going out on a limb, he speculated that "the entire land area of the globe might be mapped in this way."</blockquote>

The screen consists of concrete with embedded optical fibres, arranged as pixels, capable of transmitting natural as well as artificial light. The light-admission points are on the back of the screen where the fibres are positioned. The light, or the picture, will then be displayed in pixels on the front. The light source can be a projector emitting either pictures or film footage. In principle, the screen is capable of acting as a window since – owing to the combination of the screen concept's light-absorption and optical cables – it has a capacity for transmitting natural light.<br clear="all">

The light-admission points are on the back of the screen where the fibres are positioned. The light, or the picture, will then be displayed in pixels on the front. The light source can be a projector emitting either pictures or film footage. In principle, the screen is capable of acting as a window since – owing to the combination of the screen concept's light-absorption and optical cables – it has a capacity for transmitting natural light.<br clear="all">

Anyone who is concerned about the disregard Rumsfeld has shown for justice and human rights in Iraq can probably expect more of the same from Gates, though maybe as a more competent leader he'll be more careful that only our proxies in the Middle East do the torturing on our behalf.</blockquote>

Purcell is fixed, in other words, on the state of decay. This bent is evident in her exceptional new volume, Bookworm, which recasts mangled texts as works of art. If Purcell seems always to look backward, she is also strikingly tuned to present-day obsessions—especially our fascination with repurposing.

During the press conference today, the president made what some felt was an odd reference to computer manufacturer Dell: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B628CifhR_8">Link</a> to video. (<em>Thanks, <a href="http://www.seanbonner.com">Sean Bonner</a></em>)<p>
<font color="red">Reader comment</font>: Rodney Gardner says,

<blockquote>As long as we're forecasting on political issues BB covers, it's worth pointing out that the next chair of the also-pertinent Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet is likely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Markey">Rep. Ed Markey</a> (MA-07).
<p>
Rep. Markey is the ranking member on the E&C subcommittee right now, and has been a staunch advocate of network neutrality. (Of course, he was also the one who called for Chris Soghoian's head for the boarding pass generator...but to his credit, he did own up to his misjudgment two days later, and asked authorities to take Soghoian's intent as a researcher into account.)
<p>
All in all, the change in leadership (from the neutricidal Rep. Fred Upton) is a positive sign for fans of the internet as we know it.

When Carla and I were in New York a couple of weeks ago, our hotel room faced a building that had beautiful colored lights in the windows. I shot a short video of the light show, which you can see here.

<P>By the way, the <a href="http://www.tribecagrand.com/">Tribeca Grand</a> is a great hotel. Our room (an "<a href="http://www.tribecagrand.com/rooms/istudio.htm">iStudio</a>" room) had WiFi, a large screen Macintosh, and an iPod loaded with music. It also had two speakers that pumped out white noise, which did a great job of killing the sound that came from the bar below.

Next Tuesday, November 14, I'm presenting a rare chance to hear technology legends <a href="http://www.kapor.com/">Mitch Kapor</a>, <a href="http://toad.com/gnu/">John Gilmore</a> and <a href="http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/">John Perry Barlow</a> speak at a free event at the University of Southern California. 
<p>

All three helped found the Electronic Frontier Foundation, but that's just for starters.

<i>Mitch Kapor: Architecture is politics</i><br>
Mitch Kapor also founded Lotus and created the ground-breaking spreadsheet Lotus 1-2-3. He pioneered the "peering" that has become the norm for Internet service providers, and has gone on to lead social investing movements, as well as chairing the Open Source Applications Foundation and being a key player in the Mozilla Foundation.

<i>John Gilmore: The Internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it</i><br>
John Gilmore was employee number five at Sun Microsystems and was key
to the development of Solaris and the SPARC chip.  He went on to
cofound the USENET alt. hierarchy, The Little Garden, an early
regional ISP, and Cygnus Support, the first big free software business
(now Red Hat).  He continues to initiate and/or fund ground-breaking
free software projects like GNU Radio, BitTorrent, Gnash and
FreeS/WAN.  He's an activist for individual rights, including
challenging secret laws and identification demands, starting the
<a href="http://papersplease.org">Identity Project</a>, funding and strategizing to end
prohibition of drugs, liberating and aiding the victims of Guantanamo,
and supporting other freedom-oriented charities.

<i>John Perry Barlow: We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.</i><br>
John Perry Barlow has had several careers -- beginning as a Republican cattle-rancher who wrote lyrics for the Grateful Dead. In the early days of the public Internet, Barlow became famous as a kind of poet-laureate of the Internet, penning such influential documents as the <a href="http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html">Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace</a>. Barlow continues to serve as a powerful spokesman for online liberty.
<br clear="all">
<p>
It's exceedingly rare to have all three of these EFF founders on the same bill. In my five years of association with EFF, I've never been in the same room as all three, though I've come to know each of them  well. These three activist/entrepreneur/artists were absolutely vital to the shape of the Internet as we know it today -- they are living legends. Any one of them is worth seeing, but I can hardly contain my excitement at the thought of hearing all three together.
<p>
Space is limited, and Gilmore and Mitch have to leave right after the talk, so there won't be any extended events with all three. Arrive early to stake out your place! I'll post audio and possibly video after the event.
<p>
Where: University of Southern California main campus, Annenberg School of Communications, Room 207 (Los Angeles)<br>
When: Tuesday, November 14, 7PM-9PM.

My student Lewis Haidt has written up a great report on the <a href="">Remixing the Archive</a> event at the University of Southern California last weekend -- especially interesting is this summary of the work of Barbara Lattanzi on the early film era where movies were interactive:

<blockquote>


Next Barbara Lattanzi gave an amazing presentation. She traced back to early, early 20th Century film and showed how, at the beginning, there was a fork, the road not taken. This road gave audiences a hilarious degree of agency. We watched shorts from I think 1920's where audiences would sing back and follow songs, almost karaoke-like, before a feature. It's a radical thought: one would have happened in film became an active, agent experience where the audiences was mobilized?
<p>
She gave numerous examples in her work where she's breaking down the passivity model using idiomorphic software. My favorite was her work on the Zapruder-Kennedy assassination reworking and examples of her C-SPAN Karaoke, my favorite being the Alberto Gonzalez karaoke. I can't recommend enough that people check out her website and follow her work.

On the proposed broadcasting treaty, the report said that several members, as well as others not in the room, "will be making sure the diplomatic conference does not go ahead smoothly this week."

Here's a 22-page PDF comic book that shows you how to pick locks.

<blockquote><img src="http://www.boingboing.net/200611080940.jpg" height="169" width="130" border="0" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="200611080940" />The Credo of the Lock Picker: 

You may only pick locks that you own, or
those to which you've been given explicit
permission to pick by the rightful owner.
<P>Locksport is an honest, ethical, and legitimate hobby. Unfortunately, the whole
world hasn't figured that out yet (though we're working on it!). Because the lay
person has a tendency to perceive what we do as somehow nefarious, it is extra
important that we commit to following a strict code of ethics. For this reason,
the above credo is non-negotiable in the locksport community. Lock picking
should never, ever be used to illegal or even questionable purposes.
Please do not misuse this information. We assume no responsibility for your
actions, and in no way condone immoral activity. Help keep locksport fun for all

Here's a 22-page PDF comic book that shows you how to pick locks.

<blockquote><img src="http://www.boingboing.net/200611080940.jpg" height="169" width="130" border="0" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="200611080940" />The Credo of the Lock Picker: 

You may only pick locks that you own, or
those to which you've been given explicit
permission to pick by the rightful owner.
<P>Locksport is an honest, ethical, and legitimate hobby. Unfortunately, the whole
world hasn't figured that out yet (though we're working on it!). Because the lay
person has a tendency to perceive what we do as somehow nefarious, it is extra
important that we commit to following a strict code of ethics. For this reason,
the above credo is non-negotiable in the locksport community. Lock picking
should never, ever be used to illegal or even questionable purposes.
Please do not misuse this information. We assume no responsibility for your
actions, and in no way condone immoral activity. Help keep locksport fun for all
by following strictly the one rule.<br clear="all"></blockquote>

My former student Greg London has written a tremendous little book about copyright, in the form of a parable about the wild west. "Bounty Hunters: Metaphors for Fair Intellectual Property Laws" is a slim, Creative Commons licensed book available on demand from Lulu Press that tackles the economics of copyright through a fun, breezy little parable about a frontier town that hires bounty hunters to bring in the bad guys -- until the bounty hunters begin to fund mayoral races in exchange for ever-larger, longer-lived bounties.
<p>
London is a computer geek with a passion for economics, a subject that most techies (and non-techies for that matter) have only a rudimentary grasp over. London takes the economist's language and illuminates it with his whimsical examples in ways that make the reason that some copyrights and patents are good -- but lots more are bad -- clear.
<p>
London is a budding science fiction writer who was one of my students at this year's <a href="http://www.sff.net/paradise/">Viable Paradise</a> workshop on Martha's Vineyard; he aspires to create books professionally, and it is with this in mind that he approaches his subject. How can we give creators a fair shake without undermining the public interest?
<p>
Bounty Hunters is a clever exercise in explaining the copyfight. I suspect it will resonate strongly with some readers who haven't encountered or understood the subject.

It may be common for US committee chairs to take money from the companies they are supposed to oversee, but this is not the way it's done in Canada. The US copyright cartel has managed to export more than their cartoons and magazines and pop-stars to Canada -- they've also exported their corruption.

Yesterday, NDP Heritage critic Charlie Angus called attention to the fundraiser, noting that it promised to provide access to both Oda and guest speaker Industry Minister Maxime Bernier.  He summed it up as "the broadcast review happens in two weeks. The cash grab happens next week. Why is the minister using her office to trade political access for political contributions?"
<p>
Oda responded by arguing that she was following the law ("I have observed every rule existing right now").  Hours later, she did an about face and cancelled the fundraiser.  This should have been obvious - the Minister of Canadian Heritage simply cannot have a fundraiser hosted on her behalf by her friends in the broadcast industry.

Did your vote count this time? <a href="http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/hackingdemocracy/synopsis.html">Link</a> to synopsis at HBO website, and here's an excerpt:


<p> 	
<blockquote><img src="http://boingboing.net/images/252x190_hacking01.jpg" width="207" height="190" align="left" border="0">Electronic voting machines count about 87% of the votes cast in America today. But are they reliable? Are they safe from tampering? From a current congressional hearing to persistent media reports that suggest misuse of data and even outright fraud, concerns over the integrity of electronic voting are growing by the day. And if the voting process is not secure, neither is America's democracy. (...) HACKING DEMOCRACY exposes gaping holes in the security of America's electronic voting system.<br clear="all">
</blockquote><p>
The entire 90 minute documentary feature is available online for free via Google Video: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7236791207107726851&amp;sourceid=docidfeed&amp;hl=en-CA">Link</a>. (<em>Thanks <a href="http://ylbissop.com/life">Cheebs</a> and others</em>)<p>
<font color="red">Reader comment</font>: My friend John Parres says,

<blockquote>On CNN Jeffrey Toobin just reported that almost all of Virginia's
voting machines are electronic and do not have paper trails!  This
means the recount will only be of each machine's totals printed out at
the end of the day.  There is no way to audit each vote as you could
with, say,  optically scanned ballots. So, unless numbers got
transposed or a few "missing" machine receipts magically appear, it's
over and the Dems will have a majority in both the Senate and the
House.</blockquote>


Stephen Pigott says,

<blockquote>A quite note concerning America's problem with voting fraud and/or incompetence when depending on "voting machines" for a result. In Australia we have an ingeniously simple voting system: a piece of paper and a pencil. The voter is given a ballot paper with the candidates' names, she goes into a little cardboard booth (of sorts), where there is a stubby little pencil. The voter votes, and puts the paper in a big box. When the polls close, the votes are counted and scrutinised -- by hand -- by thousands of people around the country. If there is a dispute in a closely-fought electorate, those votes are counted again.

Simple, but almost 100% clean and effective. No power blackouts, no loose wires, no glitches. Maybe you guys should try it some time.

<blockquote><img src="http://boingboing.net/images/252x190_hacking01.jpg" width="207" height="190" align="left" border="0">Electronic voting machines count about 87% of the votes cast in America today. But are they reliable? Are they safe from tampering? From a current congressional hearing to persistent media reports that suggest misuse of data and even outright fraud, concerns over the integrity of electronic voting are growing by the day. And if the voting process is not secure, neither is America's democracy. (...) HACKING DEMOCRACY exposes gaping holes in the security of America's electronic voting system.<br clear="all">

<font color="red">Reader comment</font>: My friend John Parres says,

<blockquote>On CNN Jeffrey Toobin just reported that almost all of Virginia's
voting machines are electronic and do not have paper trails!  This
means the recount will only be of each machine's totals printed out at
the end of the day.  There is no way to audit each vote as you could
with, say,  optically scanned ballots. So, unless numbers got
transposed or a few "missing" machine receipts magically appear, it's
over and the Dems will have a majority in both the Senate and the
House.</blockquote>


Stephen Pigott says,

<blockquote>A quite note concerning America's problem with voting fraud and/or incompetence when depending on "voting machines" for a result. In Australia we have an ingeniously simple voting system: a piece of paper and a pencil. The voter is given a ballot paper with the candidates' names, she goes into a little cardboard booth (of sorts), where there is a stubby little pencil. The voter votes, and puts the paper in a big box. When the polls close, the votes are counted and scrutinised -- by hand -- by thousands of people around the country. If there is a dispute in a closely-fought electorate, those votes are counted again.

Simple, but almost 100% clean and effective. No power blackouts, no loose wires, no glitches. Maybe you guys should try it some time.

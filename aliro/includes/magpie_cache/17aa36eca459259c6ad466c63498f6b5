The Value of the Public Domain by Rufus Pollock is an excellent analysis of how one might quantify the value of the public domain. It nicely introduces what otherwise strikes many as counter intuitive. Highly recommended. 

After reading Pollock&#8217;s piece, for example, it is much easier to see the fallacy in any public policy argument that tries to suggest there is an economic harm from failing to extend the term of an existing copyright. The key is the distinction between social value and individual value.

E.g., imagine a society that every year randomly selected 100 people, and sent them a check for $1m. The $100m needed to fund this program is raised each year by a tax on everyone within the society. Then some enterprising politician says: Hey, this is a waste of resources. Let&#8217;s stop this program. While it&#8217;s simple to see why such a change would be &#8220;Armageddon&#8221; for those in the $1m club, it would take lots of hand-waiving to argue (convincingly at least) that the change would be harmful to society. 

Or remember how Macaulay (1841) put it (nicely reproduced in full by Eric Flint):The principle of copyright is this. It is a tax on readers for the purpose of giving a bounty to writers. The tax is an exceedingly bad one; it is a tax on one of the most innocent and most salutary of human pleasures; and never let us forget, that a tax on innocent pleasures is a premium on vicious pleasures. I admit, however, the necessity of giving a bounty to genius and learning. In order to give such a bounty, I willingly submit even to this severe and burdensome tax. Nay, I am ready to increase the tax, if it can be shown that by so doing I should proportionally increase the bounty.

Me too. Absolutely. Taxes are awful, but necessary. Let&#8217;s have them where necessary, but only when necessary. And so why not have them to extend the term of an existing copyright? BECAUSE THIS IS A TAX THAT CANNOT &#8220;INCREASE THE BOUNTY.&#8221; The work is already produced. No matter what we do today, Elvis is not going to produce any more recordings in 1957. So it is a tax that benefits some plainly (those who get almost twice the term they originally bargained for), but benefits society not at all. I.e., a very bad tax.

So we&#8217;ve launched a hack of the advertising system to try to raise funds for CC a bit differently. This is a new CC video (3 minutes). It&#8217;s been Revverized &#8212; meaning at the end is an ad. When people watch the video through to the ad, we get paid. Thus, by spreading and watching our video, you can help CC. And if this technique works, maybe others as well. 

You can see all our videos here. All of them have now been Revverized, though of course, we also make them available in an ad-free way. But the more who watch the Revver version, the more we raise.

So if you&#8217;d like a simple (and cheap) way to help CC, please use the email form to send the videos page to your 10,000 best friends. Ask them to send it to their 10,000 best friends. And them, to their 15,000 best friends. And soon we&#8217;ll be finished with the fundraising for the year. 

Or again, alternatively, click here to donate $300,000 and we can call the whole thing off.

It&#8217;s been <a href="http://www.revver.com">Revverized</a> &#8212; meaning at the end is an ad. When people watch the video through to the ad, we get paid. Thus, by spreading and watching our video, you can help CC. And if this technique works, maybe others as well. </p>

<p>You can see all our videos <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/videos">here</a>. All of them have now been Revverized, though of course, we also make them available in an ad-free way. But the more who watch the Revver version, the more we raise.</p>

<p>So if you&#8217;d like a simple (and cheap) way to help CC, please use the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/videos">email form</a> to send the videos page to your 10,000 best friends. Ask them to send it to their 10,000 best friends. And them, to their 15,000 best friends. And soon we&#8217;ll be finished with the fundraising for the year. </p>

<p>Or again, alternatively, click <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/donate">here</a> to donate $300,000 and we can call the whole thing off.</p>";}i:7;a:8:{s:5:"title";s:43:"Nicely slashdotted: the broadband "experts"";s:4:"link";s:48:"http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/003589.shtml";s:11:"description";s:893:"Slashdot picked up a great post by Broadband Reports about the &#8220;experts&#8221; who have banded together to oppose muni-wireless.

(Remember, we increased our copyright term to &#8220;harmonize&#8221; with the Europeans; now the Europeans are increasing their copyright terms to &#8220;harmonize&#8221; with the US. Will this cycle end? Of course not.)

The ippr just released a very smart report about IP issues generally. It identifies well the errors in this pattern of extension. (The report is not free for downloading (a problem it didn&#8217;t note), but an executive summary is here.)  And a new activist group in Britain, the UK Open Rights Group will soon release a short policy paper. 

But the real problem with this debate is that the proponents for term extension are (1) sexy media figures who (2) only discuss the issue in well choreographed events that allow no real opposition to their views to be heard, while (3) the press never adequately covers events where the issue is properly, and adequately, addressed.

Exhibit one in support of the above: This piece by a favorite of this page, Andy Orlowski (remember his really nasty piece about my representing Hardwicke in the boychoir case, ending with: &#8220;Lessig has shown an ability to clutch defeat from the jaws of victory before.&#8221; No followup by Andy after the verdict.) Orlowski usually gets media issues right. But this piece is full of the most obvious errors. (E.g., he refers to &#8220;the estimates of economic Armageddon that term extenders propose - which may be Â£143m over 10 years, according to PriceWaterhouseCooper,&#8221; never pausing to actually analyze what this &#8220;Armageddon&#8221; is: The argument is that Britain hurts because a Â£143m tax is not imposed on the British people in order to benefit the likes of Sir Cliff. Talk about trickle down economics.)

But reporters just to report what they see. So I take it Orlowski didn&#8217;t see the full story. No surprise, since as he mentioned, the &#8220;panel discussing the issue was loaded with advocates for extending copyright terms, and only one dissenter.&#8221; Ah yes, Soviet style public policy discussion, again itself not remarked in Orlowski&#8217;s article.

The sexy will never stoop to debate this issue in a fair and balanced context so long as they get away with &#8220;debating&#8221; it in the sort of contexts they do. And they get away with it only so long as the press and politicians permit them to. So let&#8217;s let this permitting stop: Britain should demand a debate about these issues in a context in which both sides get a real and balanced opportunity to present the views. 

(Meanwhile, don&#8217;t miss Jonathan Zittrain&#8217;s presentation at the Open Rights Group &#8220;Release the Music&#8221; event on November 13. Details here and here.)

I&#8217;m eager that an alternative get pushed into this debate. As mentioned before,  MP Don Foster has suggested terms should be extended only for those who ask. For works whose copyright owners don&#8217;t ask, the copyright would pass into the public domain. I made a similar proposal to the Gowers Commission.  It would be fantastic if Britain took the lead in this obvious compromise to an obviously mistaken policy &#8212; term extension for existing works.

Meanwhile, as a demonstration of the value of the public domain, if you&#8217;re not in the US, you can get access to this fantastic collection of 1500 LPs of classical music, in the public domain in Europe, but not in the US, digitized and made available by the EuropeanArchive. Don&#8217;t count on access to this anytime soon, United States: Nothing published will enter the public domain in the US through the expiration of a copyright term until 2019.

This is nothing new for NBC. In August, 2004, I wrote about an attempt by filmmaker Robert Greenwald to license a 1 minute clip from Meet the Press, in which the President explained his reasons for going to war. Greenwald was denied the permission, his agent told they could not use it because the clip was &#8220;not very flattering to the president.&#8221;

At that time, a lawyer from NBC protested to me that what I had written was not true. I asked how he knew that. I had interviewed the woman who had spoken to the NBC permissions person. I had known her independently of this incident. I knew her to be an honest person. So how did he know she was lying? 

Because she must be lying, I was told. NBC would never do anything like this. 

Right. Never. Except at least twice.
